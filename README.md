HI! Welcome to Task Tracker by me, Prince14.
This is my first ever real github project using python.
Please leave a comment so i can improve! :)

How To Use :
First, open the code using any IDE you like, then run the code.
Next, type in your command of choice. Type in 'help' for list of commands!
Finally, use the program as you want :)

Features :
1. Add, delete or edit your tasks.
2. Add your description to the task.
3. Mark a status to your task as done or currently doing.
4. list all your tasks, also list per status.
5. "break" to exit the program.
