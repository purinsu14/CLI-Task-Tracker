HI! Welcome to Task Tracker by me, Prince14.
This is my first ever real github project using python.
Please leave a comment so i can improve! :)

This is a Task Tracker designed for quick and simple use.
First, open the code using any IDE you like, then run the code.
Next, type in your command of choice. Type in 'help' for list of commands!
Finally, use the program as you want :)

Here is the project page i use
